# FEMA LAYER FIXES REPORT

## Summary
The FEMA layer indices were **WRONG** and showing incorrect data. After comprehensive testing of service endpoints, I discovered the correct layer configurations and fixed the issues.

## Problems Found and Fixed

### 1. **Fire Stations Layer** ❌ → ✅
- **PROBLEM**: Was showing emergency medical locations instead of fire stations
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Wrong layer index - was using layer 1, but fire stations are in layer 2
- **SOLUTION**: 
  - **OLD**: `Structures_Medical_Emergency_Response_v1/FeatureServer/1`
  - **NEW**: `Structures_Medical_Emergency_Response_v1/FeatureServer/2` (Fire_Stations_EMS_Stations)

### 2. **Local Law Enforcement** ❌ → ✅  
- **PROBLEM**: Showing NOTHING (empty data)
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Wrong service - was trying to use Medical Emergency Response layer 2

  - **NEW**: `Structures_Law_Enforcement_v1/FeatureServer/0` (Police_Stations)

### 3. **Prison Boundaries** ❌ → ✅

  - **NEW**: `Structures_Education_v1/FeatureServer/2` (All K-12 Schools)

### 6. **Public Schools** ❌ → ✅
- **PROBLEM**: Showing NOTHING - service didn't exist
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Wrong service URL - `USA_Schools` doesn't exist
